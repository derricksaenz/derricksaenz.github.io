          My name is Derrick Saenz, and I am a digital media artist. My main crafts include digital graphic design, video art, and photography. Most of the work I do is for others, including organizations I am a part of, whether as a job or as a volunteer. A lot of my recent work has been used to benefit my church, Iglesia Biblica Bautista Vida Nueva, and the youth group I lead there. I put so much of my time and effort into the work I make for them because I love what I do. I love my church and I love design, so putting them together makes the job a whole lot easier.<br><br>
          I have been experimenting a lot in my recent work, trying to teach myself ways of making art without the full backing of a design theory course. I am not a graphic design major, but I do know that designers are here to solve problems, and that is the goal of my work, even if the problem is “just” an amateurish logo representing an organization.

          I feel that my work has the greatest effect on the screen, where most people can currently find my work, but it warms my heart every time I see something I made printed out as a flyer and posted around campus or at my church. It is something I wish I had more time to do and something I definitely want to learn more about. Printing and production are in my scopes in what to learn about next, and I look forward to how I can go from printing on what I think would be nice to what I know will make a good impression.<br><br>
          Alongside my design work, I also dabble in DSLR photography, something I find extremely intuitive and fun. While I don’t see myself doing photography for a living, I do enjoy taking a camera out to get some nice pictures. My main focus has always been landscapes or non-person subjects, but I recently also challenged myself to go for some portrait photography. I plan to explore more as time goes on.<br><br><br>

          I am a leader in Iglesia Biblica Bautista Vida Nueva, a local church in Castro Valley, CA. There I serve God by using my talents in the best way I know how, and I have become a leader there in the church.

        <h2>Anchored At Heart</h2>
        <p><img style="float: right; width: 33%; margin-left: 50px; margin-bottom: 25px;" alt="Logo for the Anchored At Heart Student Ministry at Iglesia Biblica Bautista Vida Nueva" src="images/about/AaH Logo Art Color onLight.svg">
          My role as youth leader in my church's youth group is to stimulate spiritual growth among the teens and to help them form closer relationships with each other as well as with God. On occasion, I hold the studies in the youth group, but mainly my role is to facilitate the games and lead the youth in following the plans for the activities planned that day or evening.<br><br>
          Besides working directly with our teens, I use my experience in art and design to create a sort of “brand” for the Anchored at Heart group. This mostly consists of a concise design language for presentations, font choices, announcement slides, and most importantly merchandise. Every year, the youth group has a new shirt for the teens and/or their families. However, in 2018, I decided to make not one, but three designs for the group, which can be seen in the Portfolio page, all with various products to sport the designs. All of the merchandise is non-profit, so while the supplier makes their profit, I do not want to earn money from the designs. That way, the teens and their families will be able to more easily afford the designs. I intend to keep the train rolling with these projects to help contribute to the success of the youth group.<br><br>
          In addition, I serve to fill the technological roles of the youth group. Every meeting we have, we start off with songs of worship to encourage the teens to find joy in praise, and that means we need something to read off of for every song. I help out with the simple action of changing the slides but also I create the slides. The slides are made to be easy to read as well as visually appealing. The slides also have the guitar chords right on the lyrics, so that way our teen guitarist can more comfortably follow along as she learns. And at the same time, our lead guitarist (the pastor of the church) can play the song<br><br>
          It is a huge joy to work closely with these teens and I look forward to every youth activity and event I am able to attend.

        <h2>Technology and Support</h2>
        <p>
          As the leader of the technology ministry in the church, my responsibility is to show up early to set up the live-streaming equipment and the service computer. We broadcast each of our services for members who are unable to attend regular services as well as anyone who happens to stumble upon our channel, Vida Nueva Media.<br><br>
          The service computer is used to display the hymns we will be singing each service, the announcements on events coming up soon, and any presentations the speaker will be presenting, like missionary presentations and sermons. My team and I are responsible for the functionality of the computer and the smooth flow of the service.
