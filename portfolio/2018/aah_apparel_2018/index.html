          <h1>Anchored At Heart Apparel Designs (Winter 2018)</h1>
          <img src="aah_designs_2018720.jpg" id="myImg" class="portfolioimg"></img>
          <p>The Christmas season came up once again, and something in Anchored At Heart felt like it was missing from the year. Usually, a singular shirt design would be made in the summertime in time for our annual trip for Wolf Mountain, but that did not happen this year. So, because of the absence of the shirt from earlier in the year (and because of the Christmas spirit) I wanted to surprise my teens with something more than just a shirt.</p>
          <p>I got to work on one of the longer design projects I have worked on, as of December 2018. This project allowed me to explore different ways to design something for a different group of people. This increased flexibility in the way that I work also translated into the kinds of products I can provide to my teens, like hats and their long-awaited hoodies. </p>
          <p>From what I observed, the teens absolutely loved the designs and the apparel that matched. Within my church, there was 35 orders across the board, and considering the size of my youth group (which is around 20 teens), I would call this a huge success.</p>
          <p>It makes me happy to see the joy that comes from my group, especially when it is from something that I did right. This not only was a learning experience in how to design for a diverse audience, but also how to come to terms with the positive feedback one gets from going a good job.</p>
