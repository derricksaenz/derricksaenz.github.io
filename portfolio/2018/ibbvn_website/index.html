          <p>My church, Iglesia Bíblica Bautista Vida Nueva, had a website that was run on Wordpress. The original person who had made the site did a great job in keeping it up to date and functional, but once they were called to serve elsewhere, I took responsibility over the website.</p>
          <p>I decided that best way to move forward would be to rebuild the website from the ground up, allowing both me and my pastor to work on it and learn how to make the site a central hub for the church's online presence. I wanted to make the site look modern, leaving an old style that many people were used to behind. The style is meant to be easy for everyone to interact with (even our older members) and attractive for anyone to use (even our younger members).</p>
          <p>I created the website on volunteer time, and I am proud to say that it came out beautifully. Most of the assets there, including the logos, icons, and photos, were created by me, with a few exceptions still being made in-church by Robert Ortega, the aforementioned original moderator of the church's site.</p>
          <p>There are plans to move this website to be entirely developed without a builder, so please look forward to a new update there.</p>
