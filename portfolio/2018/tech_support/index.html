          <p>This video was more of a personal study of lighting and color, two things I had not worked with prior to this short film. My intention with the video was not to make an exciting story, or to make a knee-slapper of a comedy, but to experiment with the tools provided to me. I think that the end product was something that I am happy to have made.</p>
          <p>The best parts about this for me are the way the true colors of the picture show. My use of lights was something I believed necessary in such a dark environment. The idea and the wish to discover was born when I heard about “Hollywood darkness”, where the nighttime or dark areas aren’t really that dark, but instead creatively lit to create the illusion of darkness. This includes lighting for contours or for contrast, or making lighting come from only certain sources, lowing the amount of ambient light that exists in the daytime.</p>
          <p>One of my favorite successes of this picture was the amber glow of the whiskey bottle. No, I nor anyone in my household drinks alcoholic beverages, but having the bottle was useful to make the effect that I wanted. The amber showed through beautifully, and I think that the extreme color correction worked phenomenally.</p>
          <p>Color correcting and editing this was an exercise for me, as I always have strived for “realism” in the past, and I never let myself get creative with the way things looked. I love the grungy, high contrast look, and I think this was a step in the right direction.</p>
          <p>This film also taught me a little about myself, that I am not someone who likes to direct, but instead work with a team to create a clear idea.</p>
