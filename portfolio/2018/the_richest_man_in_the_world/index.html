          <p>Near the beginning of the spring 2018 semester in San Jose State, I began writing a short film that I had no idea how to write. It involved themes that I had little to no experience in, and the only experience in film making I had was a short film in 2015 that I felt didn't succeed in its purpose. So, making this new, extremely ambitious one was a bit of a stretch. I figured that because I was older and perhaps wiser, I'd be able to make a good film without that said experience.</p>
          <p>What ended up happening is that my Digital Media class required a short video instead. So, in order to manage my time, I stopped writing that film and instead focused on a short script for what will be this film.</p>
          <p>Making this film was not only a blast to make, but also a huge blessing and fountain of experience. I learned so much about how to write a film, as well as direct one too. It helped me understand that not all ideas are communicated in the manner the writer always wants them to.</p>
