          <p>2019 is the second year that the Anchored At Heart youth group has had these unique designs for their yearly apparel. It’s felt like the youth group has gone a long way since last year, and the designs should reflect that.</p>
          <p>Between 2018’s designs and 2019’s designs, much has changed in the way things are run, and who does what. For example, I started formally teaching the youth group every other week, and I believe it has been a blessing to the group. Along with this change, my design preferences have changed, as well as my design philosophy. In 2018, the designs were very self-identifying. While they did have a great brand presence, they didn’t have a huge meaning behind each design, something I wanted to change with the upcoming 2019 design.</p>
          <p>For my favorite design of the two, “Heart on Fire”, I wanted to bring the Anchored At Heart group to another idea than just being anchored to Jesus, but also being zealous for God. One passage that comes to mind is Psalm 63, talking about a passion for God. That is one place where I think that at this point my youth group can grow. The main design contains a couple essential pieces: the flame and the anchor cut-out. My favorite thing about the flame element is that is does double-duty as a powerful flame, but also as a heart (in its anatomical shape). Not only is this a great double-meaning, but it is consistent with the objective for the growing Christian: be tethered to Jesus and his teachings and be passionate like a well-fed fire.</p>
