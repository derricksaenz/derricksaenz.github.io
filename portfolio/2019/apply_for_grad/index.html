          <p>While this poster was a relatively simple project, it was still a very interesting endeavor to partake in. This task was given to me by my office job, one that doesn’t require graphic design experience whatsoever. My task was to make a flyer to inform students about the graduation process. After making an initial word document with this same exact information, I had some time on my hands and decided to make a larger poster to add to screens around the art building and to send in an email out to students instead of the regular boring Word Document.</p>
          <p>This was the result, one that I think adheres to the new branding San Jose State University uses across a lot of its new media. As a student assistant in the Art Office, I was given access to the SJSU Spartan font as well as a library of student submitted photos, and from there, I was able to make a poster that is both visually appealing and is able to look the part as an official poster from the university.</p>
          <p>This poster also serves as an example in how I work with text both in the writing and in the typography. In writing, while I had ideas I needed to hit, most of the text is there to ensure that I delivered clear and concise points to the reader. In the typography, I made sure to create a clear sense of hierarchy in the message. While the text at the top is aligned right, usually not recommended for the bodycopy, I used it to reinforce the asymmetry of the section. The QR Code in the bottom right corner creates a weight that already promotes an asymmetrical look, so I wanted to make sure the weight wasn’t alone in its “push” to the right side of the page. Above that, it is a short read, so the reader won’t get lost in the short section.</p>
