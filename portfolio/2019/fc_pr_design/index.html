          <p>“Fire Canyon Company” and “Pacific Railworks” were two companies that we made up to use as rivaling teams for a summer program we were holding at church. One of the awesome things about my church is that we are a creative bunch of people. We come up the ideas ourselves and write the lessons for the summer in house. </p>
          <p>I like to work on both sides of the program, in the lessons and in the creative direction, but because of my involvement with Wolf Mountain in Summer 2019, I was tasked to stick only to the creative direction. </p>
          <p>My goal was to create a couple of designs that would not only look real and presentable as the logos of two old west transportation giants, but also to get the kids of the church to rally with their team. This meant I needed bold and exciting logos with distinct and opposing colors. The pinwheel parts of each logo and the bold fonts in each logo kept the style consistent, but also kept the attention on the logo itself, always bringing the eye back to it. </p>
          <p>It was exciting to work on these logos and to see the kids wear the logos on their hart hats, and I am grateful for the opportunity.</p>
