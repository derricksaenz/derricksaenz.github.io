          <p>Lifeboat Apparel is a small Christian apparel business dedicated to serving a message through design and putting it in apparel. The goal for Lifeboat Apparel is to make art in the medium of prints on apparel like shirts and hoodies that also serves a purpose to deliver thought to a Christian mind, or to those who see another wearing the clothing. </p>
          <p>A lot of inspiration comes from the songs I listen to, as well as a message I heard at church. In Matthew 27:46, when he was on the cross, “Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?”. This statement wasn’t just a cry, but also a call to the witnesses of the crucifixion, mostly Jews. The cry referenced a psalm, and in today’s Bibles, can be found in Psalms 22, which starts with “My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me”. Many Jews would know this psalm by heart, just like how many of us know songs by memory. If I said, “Amazing grace, how sweet the sound” to a group of Christians, they would reply “who saved a wretch like me”. This example applies to anyone with any song, not just hymns or Christian songs. So if the witnesses heard Jesus cry “Eli Eli, lama sabachthani”, then many Jews watching the crucifixion would remember the rest of the psalm, and remember that the psalm is about rescue from torments, something that really resonated with the Jews at this time (waiting for a Messiah to deliver them from the Romans).</p>
          <p>While song isn’t the only thing that inspired me to start this business, it is a principle factor for which I made the designs for the business. This project helped me hone my interests and explore a design style I was not used to, which influenced future ideas.</p>
