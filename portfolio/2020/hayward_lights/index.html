      <p>“Hayward Lights” and “Hayward Blur” are two photographs I took to serve as an experiment on my part. As an occasional photographer, I don’t have a lot of time on my hands to go out and take the pictures I would like to. Thankfully, I found some time to go out with some friends and make our way to the local college, Cal State East Bay, at night and take some photos.</p>
      <p>The flagship photo of the two is Hayward Lights. It is a panorama of the city of Hayward, from downtown to the San Mateo Bridge. This served as great practice for me to work on low light focus on an entry level camera, but more importantly to see how much I have to appreciate the city I grew up in. Hayward is close to San Francisco and Oakland, so those are the popular cities many people love to visit, but Hayward is special in that it isn’t yet as big as those cities. There aren’t towers, or skyscrapers, or tourist attraction, but there is a great community and a quickly growing new infrastructure that accounts for the new technology around us, something the leadership is taking great initiative on. To see the hustle from afar is almost soothing, seeing that I am lucky to live in a beautiful city.</p>
      <p>Hayward Blur is the second photo, one that came as a happy accident. Taking the picture before focusing led to this beautiful bokeh effect, and the colors made this photo stand out even more.</p>
