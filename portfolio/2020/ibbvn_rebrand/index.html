          <h1>Iglesia Biblica Bautista Vida Nueva 2020 Re-brand</h1>

          <figcaption class="portfolioimg">Logos printed on paper. Render by Derrick Saenz using Adobe Dimension</figcaption>
          <p>Upon the request of the pastor of Igelsia Biblica Bautista Vida Nueva, I was tasked to “freshen up” the existing logos of the church. The old designs were starting to show their age, with lost files, unknown fonts, and rushed logos. The new decade welcomed a new look to the now dated branding of the church. </p>
          <hr id="ibbvn">

          <h2>All Things Are Become New</h2>
          <img src="ibbvn720.jpg" class="portfolioimg" alt="Redesigned IBBVN Logo">
          <!--<video src="" class="portfolioimg" autoplay muted loop>
            <img src="" class="portfolioimg" alt="Still from animated Logo Formation video" title="Your browser does not support this video.">
          </video>-->
          <p>“Vida Nueva” is Spanish for “New Life”, and the task was to replicate this tagline in the design. While this was reached in the logo’s original iteration, my task was to clean up the design. The cross logo was updated to fit its own original purpose to serve both as a cross and a root, sapling, or branch. It's modest and natural green represents the growth of the church of Christ.</p>
          <hr id="typography">

          <h2>Old (fonts) Shall Pass Away</h2>
          <video src="typography.mp4" class="portfolioimg" autoplay muted loop>
            <img src="typography.png" class="portfolioimg" title="Your browser does not support this video." alt="New Church Typography">
          </video>
          <p>One of the biggest problems with the old line-up of logos was how inconsistent the fonts and colors were from each other. While the colors were a good starting point, the typefaces were all over the place, and that needed to change.</p>
          <p>Pastor Luis Palacios gave me a simple instruction: to make the new logo(s) modern and clean. So I needed to pick a new typeface. My first thought was to a geometric sans typeface, and Avenir Next gave the best results with tracking, legibility, and overall cleanliness in its design. Avenir Next is also flexible, allowing the design to look great while changing a lot of settings at the same time. This is obvious when you compare the Damas and Varones logos (both of which you can see below).</p>
          <hr id="anchored">

          <h2>A Sure and Steady Anchor</h2>
          <img src="aah720.jpg" class="portfolioimg"></img>
          <p>The anchor was adjusted to be cleaner and more geometric, giving it a sharp and study feel to the anchor, while still keeping the ribbon style that was voted on originally a few years ago.</p>
          <p>This particular identity was one of the most important things for me to get right, not only becasue I am one of the youth leaders of this group, but becasue I know how much it can mean to the teens in their general experience with the group. Teens have this stronger sense to feel like they belong, and if they have a group to represent, then they will be more keen to doing so.</p>
          <p>The mentality here is that it is better that they are able to relate and identify with the church's youth group than to identify with another secular group or symbol of capitalism (like a big clothing brand). It is fundamental to keeping their attention, and if I can design something that is not only visually appealing, but also makes the teens want to represent it, then I can safely say that I have succeeded as a designer for the group.</p>
          <p>I use this logo (and formerly its predecessor) to design media and apparel for the teens. Given that I see them wear the hoodies and shirts I have designed almost every week when I see them, I think that this logo is a success in the context of this rebranding.</p>
          <hr id="pulse">

          <h2>The Strength of my Heart</h2>
          <img src="pulse720.jpg" class="portfolioimg"></img>
          <p>Pulse, the college and career ministry, is a group full of energy from young adults who are growing in maturity and responsibility, but they are also growing increasingly in their faith. The energetic blue with the symbolism of the pulse reflects the life that the Pulse group puts in the church.</p>
          <p>Pulse's theme verse is Psalm 73:26, which says "My flesh and my heart faileth: but God is the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever." With this in mind, the idea of the pulse logo fits even better. Not only is it a reminder of our own frailty and mortality (our lives tied to the constant beating of the flesh that fails us), but it is also the life that God can give us. The main workmark logo shows this more clearly, as the first signal of a "pulse" is at the end, as if the person was resuscitated or revived. </p>
          <hr id="damas">

          <h2>Kind and Worthy of Respect</h2>
          <img src="damas720.jpg" class="portfolioimg"></img>
          <p>Damas is the women's ministry of the church, and I decised to go for a a soft and sweet design for the group. This logo was particularly challenging, because the topics the group covers is varied, and my knowledge is limited, as I don't attend this ministry. So I decided to keep the rose imagery, but further integrate it into the logo.</p>
          <p>A rose still keeps the theme of growth from the main church, but is also a symbol of beauty and elegance. While it is a beautiful flower, the rose is still modest and fine. The curves of the logo keep this fine detail while detaching the flower from feeling amatuerishly real. The rose now feels more smooth than of rigged, to the benefit of the whole logo.</p>
          <p>The eye is instantly drawn to the green of the stem, drawn to the rose, then brought through the logo with the word and gradient helping the reader along the way. Overall, the weight of the text is smooth and gentle, promoting the energy I am going for in the logo.</p>
          <hr id="varones">

          <h2>Be Strong and Courageous</h2>
          <img src="varones720.jpg" class="portfolioimg"></img>
          <p>Varones is the men's ministry of the church (as Varones means "men" in spanish), and it felt fitting that they would need a strong and sharp logo. The previous logo featured a sword, and given the culture, I figured it would be wise to keep it, given it is a symbol of strength, defense, and fortitude. It also helps that an upside-down sword resembles a cross.</p>
          <p>I used the sword to form a part of the "V" in Varones, as it felt to be the most natural way to integrate it into the design. It gives the V a sharp and formidable feeling to it, which is exactly how I want people to feel when starting to read through the logo. Though simple, the rest of the logo still gives a strong presence, keeping the tone of the logo consistent.</p>
          <p>The Varones group often uses the examples of strong men in the Bible, principally Jesus' twelve disciples. This is why I included the twelve circles in the bottom of the logo. It serves as a clean "flourish", but also as symbolism to the disciples.</p>
