          <p>When the new year came along, my church got a new theme verse which warranted a request to update the posters mounted at the front of the sanctuary. My pastor asked me to design a new poster for the church and gave me a few requirements for the design: put the full verses, emphasize a certain phrase, and make it legible yet attractive in design.</p>
          <p>I believe the poster was successful on all the required fronts and then some. The poster contained the complete text found in the passage, it emphasizes the requested phrase, and it kept the text legible both in the smaller text and in the larger text. The elegance display typeface matches wonderfully with the softness of the smaller body typeface</p>
          <p>In addition to these requirements, I made decisions to keep the poster related to growth and nature, one of the design themes of the church. The poster is decorated with a forest, which can be interpreted as a full congregation of growing people. All those trees had to grow from something, and the goal of the background is meant to reflect the status of the church: growing and tightly knitted.</p>
          <p>As of January 2020, the design has been printed and two posters were hung at the front of the sanctuary. The pastor has been using them as an engagement tool within his lessons, and the congregation has been using them to read along (further proof of their legibility). </p>
          <p>I am proud of the outcome of the design and I look forward to future poster projects with the church.</p>
